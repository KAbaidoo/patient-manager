# Patient Management System

A fully functional application for managing patient information at a clinic.

## Description

Before transitioning into tech I worked in healthcare, this was my motivation to create this application for managing patient information. Technologies used include [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [EJS](https://ejs.co/). The application includes validation for users.

## Installation

- Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed.
- Clone the repository

```
npm install
npm start
```

- Access on `http://localhost:4000`

## Usage

- The system requires users to be register and log in before usage.
- A new patient can be registered with basic information.
- Upon selecting the patient from a list, more information about the patient become visible.
- A user can edit patient information.
- A user can add payments made by a patient.

## Further Work

- More fields can be added to store more patient information.
- Implement proper dialog messages.
